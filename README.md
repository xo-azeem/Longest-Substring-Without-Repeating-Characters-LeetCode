# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

LeetCode Q # 3.

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

>Input: s = "abcabcbb"</br>
>Output: 3</br>
>Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.</br>

Example 2:

>Input: s = "bbbbb"</br>
>Output: 1</br>
>Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.</br>

Example 3:

>Input: s = "pwwkew"</br>
>Output: 3</br>
>Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.</br>
>Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.</br>
